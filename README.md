# Newton-s-method-for-systems-of-non-linear-equations-an-application-to-an-ODE-problem
Implementation of the generalized Newton's method for solving non-linear systems from Boundary Value Problems (BVPs). This project, developed for my Bachelor's Thesis in Mathematics, uses central finite differences and the Thomas algorithm to solve second-order non-linear ODEs in MatLab.
